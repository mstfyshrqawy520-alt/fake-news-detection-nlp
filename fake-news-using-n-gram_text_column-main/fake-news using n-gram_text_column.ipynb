Fatou Bensouda said in a statement that there is a  reasonable basis to believe  war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed and that all sides in the conflict would be examined. The prosecutor will focus on crimes allegedly committed since May 2003 on the territory of Afghanistan, and war crimes closely linked to the situation in Afghanistan allegedly committed since July 2002 on the territory of other states. The prosecutor on Friday did not mention any specific parties to be investigated. In a report last year, ICC prosecutors identified  potential cases  among three groups of alleged perpetrators: the Taliban and its affiliates, the Afghan authorities and members of the U.S. armed forces and Central Intelligence Agency. There were preliminary grounds to believe U.S. forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan and at CIA detention facilities elsewhere in 2003 and 2004, it said. The alleged atrocities took place in all 34 of Afghanistan s provinces, with a smaller number of crimes alleged in Poland, Lithuania and Romania, where suspected members of the Taliban or Al Qaeda were held for questioning. If authorized by the court s judges, prosecutors will investigate  in an independent, impartial and objective way, crimes within the court s jurisdiction allegedly committed by any party to the armed conflict.   The ultimate focus will be upon those most responsible for the most serious crimes,  she said in the statement. The ICC was established in 2002 as the world s permanent court for prosecuting the most serious war crimes, including genocide. It has the backing of the European Union and dozens of nations, but several of the world s most powerful countries - notably the United States, Russia and China - never joined. Former U.S. administrations first opposed the court s establishment, citing fears that American service members would be targeted by politically-motivated prosecutions, but later backed ad hoc investigations. A court of last resort, the ICC only steps in when a country s government is found to be unwilling or unable to do so. ICC jurisdiction is limited to crimes committed on the territory of member states, or in cases referred to it by the U.N. Security Council, as happened with Sudan over alleged genocide in Darfur in 2005. However, crimes committed on the soil of member states by soldiers of countries who are not members also fall under the court s jurisdiction under international law. If a state can show it has investigated and prosecuted the same crimes the ICC is looking into, it could avoid any case ending up in The Hague. In a 2016 report on the preliminary examination of alleged crimes in Afghanistan, the prosecutor noted that while the U.S. Dept. of Justice has looked into allegations of ill treatment of CIA detainees in 2009-2011, the scope of the probe was limited and two cases did not result in a prosecution. \",\n          \"November 12, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Viktor Pirozhenko, Izvestiya - translated by J. Arnoldski -  \\n\\n\\nOn her Facebook page, Verkhovna Rada deputy Nadezhda Savchenko urged future US President Donald Trump to maintain and strengthen sanctions against Russia. In fact, she foreshadowed similar, official calls of the sort from Kiev to the new US administration.  \\nSuch calls will necessarily follow insofar as the entire foreign policy of the Kiev regime is based on simple-minded and destructive assumptions: lobbying the West for extending anti-Russian sanctions and begging for aid and loans.  \\nHowever, likely changes in US foreign policy under Trump, including in relations with the Kiev regime, as well as internal political processes in Ukraine itself could seriously change both the relationship between Kiev and Washington and the balance of political forces within the Kiev regime.  \\nOverall, the situation in Ukraine is developing in the direction of early parliamentary elections with the possibility of nominating the now former head of the Odessa regional administration, Mikhail Saakashvili, for president in 2019. \\nThe US itself long ago formulated the clear demand for a new, distinctly pro-American oriented political force that could replace the Maidan politicians of the first wave. Washington, in the face of the departing Obama Administration, has finally refused to trust Poroshenko, Yatsenyuk, Avakov, and their entourage. \\nDonald Trump, on the basis of his foreign policy ideas, will most likely significantly reduce the US\\u2019 active participation in ideologically-driven foreign policy actions like the Obama Administration\\u2019s policy in Ukraine.  \\nDuring his election campaign, Trump promised to transition US foreign policy to \\\"breaking even\\\" and threatened to stimulate America\\u2019s European allies to take greater responsibility for Ukraine upon themselves.  \\nIn this situation, the number of those in Ukraine who want to show that replacing the corrupt government of Poroshenko and the People\\u2019s Front with a new pro-American government will allow the West to economize on aid to Ukraine is increasing. Trump\\u2019s foreign policy positions paradoxically give Saakashvili and the pro-American groups oriented towards him in Kiev an additional argument for the new administration and a powerful lever of pressure on Poroshenko and his entourage. We will soon see how Trump will react to these arguments. \\nIn addition to Saakashvili and his Volna (\\\"Wave\\\") party, the \\u201cLeshchenko-Nayem group\\u201d is trying to become the new pro-Western bet in Ukraine. This group makes up the core of the Democratic Alliance party and a large mass of the pro-Western oriented public opinion leaders and influential officials in Kiev and in the regions. \\nWashington\\u2019s unwillingness to destabilize the overall socio-political situation in Ukraine to such an extent that it would spin out of the US\\u2019 control is, like before, hindering the Americans from removing Poroshenko from the post of president. Poroshenko remains, but in such a situation, the role and importance of those pro-American oriented political forces who will start keeping a close eye on the corrupt team of the head of the Kiev regime will only grow. \\nWashington\\u2019s claims against Kiev, duplicated by the American column in Ukraine, concern the lack of professionalism in the state administration, the indulgence of corruption, the use of grey financial schemes in the economy, robbing the budget, the misuse of foreign loans, etc.  \\nAt the present moment, the anti-Poroshenko and pro-American forces in Ukrainian politics remain fragmented, but they now understand the necessity of unifying.  \\nThe problem is that the \\u201cyoung reformers\\u201d that the Obama Administrated hedged its bets in Ukraine on, just like the third pro-American forces (besides the Poroshenko Bloc and People\\u2019s Front) have turned out to be at loggerheads with the future US president, Trump.  \\nDeputies Sergey Leshchenko and Mustafa Nayem are favorites of Joe Biden and Victoria Nuland who openly played along with Hillary Clinton\\u2019s election campaign. Leshchenko personally initiated the \\\"off-the-books\\\" scandal with the Party of Regions which forced Paul Manafort, the head of Trump\\u2019s election headquarters, to leave his post. The only chance for them now is to escape to Saakashvili\\u2019s patronage, who will be the only one in the Kiev regime that didn\\u2019t play in any anti-Trump campaign. \\nSaakashvilli and his party, just like the Democratic Alliance, Yulia Tymoshenko\\u2019s Fatherland party, and the Opposition Bloc, are interested in early parliamentary elections and are likely to promote them. Saakashvili\\u2019s resignation, urgent party building, and the convulsive social and political activity of Poroshenko\\u2019s opponents show that no one in the opposition wants to wait until 2019. And so, a congress of the Democratic Alliance party is being prepared which will finally determine a program and elect a leadership. Someone is also trying to organize Volna.  \\nWhether the Trump Administration will give a green light to early parliamentary elections is unknown. However, Poroshenko\\u2019s competitors are obviously counting on their activism to influence the Trump Administration\\u2019s position and put the need to support such choices in front of it.  \\n\\nIn one way or another, some of Poroshenko\\u2019s competitors have perceived the change of government in the US not only as a challenge, but as a window of opportunity for themselves. Taking into account this factor, the development of events in Ukraine increases the likelihood of a change in the balance of political forces and early parliamentary elections.  \\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n\",\n          \"Americans need to know that gun control is not just an issue leftist legislators are pushing.  Educators  and school administrators are making it clear that even the suggestion or thought of a gun by students, regardless of age, is evil and will be punished. When this story first came out in the news, we thought it had to be fake. Once we realized it was a real story and that a 2nd grader had actually been suspended for chewing a pop-tart into the shape of a gun, we applauded his father for taking the matter to court. We assumed any reasonable judge would rule against the irresponsible parties involved in their reckless decision to suspend this 7 year old boy, and that the boy s suspension would be reversed. Were we ever wrong The suspension of second grader who chewed his breakfast pastry into the shape of a gun was upheld by a circuit court judge last week.Joshua Welch was suspended from Anne Arundel County s Park Elementary in March 2013 after chewing his pastry into the shape of a gun and  [pretending] to fire it.  The student s father, B.J. Welch, took the matter to court in hopes of having the suspension reversed and expunged from his son s record.But WJZ 13 reports that an Anne Arundel County circuit judge upheld the suspension, ruling that Joshua s actions were  disruptive. Anne Arundel County Schools reacted to the ruling by releasing a statement which said,  We have believed from the outset that the actions of the school staff were not only appropriate and consistent, but in the best interests of all students. Welch family attorney Robin Ficker lamented the ruling and pointed out there was  no violence, no real weapon, no ammunition.  But the suspension will now  be on [Joshua s] record in school  every time he goes into a new grade.

manufacturing sector as part of a national push to discourage outsourcing in the industry. The proposal would work with a broader campaign to encourage companies to build and expand their U.S. manufacturing operations. Clinton is slated to roll out the proposal on Friday in Syracuse, New York, ahead of the state\\u2019s nominating contest on April 19. New York has long been a hub of the manufacturing industry, but suffered significant declines in the sector in recent years. From 2000-2008, upstate New York alone lost nearly 105,000 manufacturing jobs, according to the state government. Clinton maintains a lead in the state, which she represented in the U.S. Senate, over rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. Senator from Vermont and a New York native.  Sanders was born and raised in New York City\\u2019s borough of Brooklyn. The Clinton campaign is headquartered there.  The campaign said the proposal\\u2019s multi-billion dollar price tag would largely be covered by Clinton\\u2019s proposed \\u201cclawback\\u201d tax, which would rescind tax relief for companies that outsource jobs or facilities abroad. \",\n          \"About Media skeptic After Abandoning Kurds to Erdogan's Invasion US Now Expects Them to Win the 'Race to Raqqa' for It \\nBut the Kurdish militias are saying they don't intend to expose themselves to a Turkish stab in the back Donate!

(And BTW Russia is not invited .) \\n\\\"It starts in the next few weeks,\\\" he said, referring to the timeline for an assault led by Arab and Kurdish fighters on ISIS' Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. \\\"That has long been our plan and we will be capable of resourcing both.\\\" \\nCarter added: \\\"It's been long a part of our plan that the Mosul operation would kick off when it did. This was a plan that goes back many months now and that Raqqa would follow soon behind. \\\" \\nTake from this what you will. Perhaps this is empty talk to boost the Democrats' ISIS-fighting credentials and help Hillary on November 8. Perhaps it is a ruse of war meant to prevent ISIS from reinforcing Mosul from Syria. \\nOr perhaps Ash Carter is actually serious. In which case I fear for Ash Carter. \\nAmericans have explained that when they mean they're going to take Raqqa that really means that Syrian Kurds are going to take Raqqa for them: \\n\\\"The only force that is capable on any near term timeline are the Syrian Democratic Forces, of which the YPG are a significant portion,\\\" said Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend in a news briefing. \\\"We'll move soon to isolate Raqqa with the forces that are ready to go.\\\" \\nIn fact the Kurdish YPG are more than a \\\"significant portion\\\" of the SDF, they're easily 75% of its fighting strength, probably more. And herein lies the problem because even as US officials acknowledge Kurds aren't exactly eager to die so US can claim credit for expelling ISIS from a wholly non-Kurdish city. \\nArab forces are expected to be the ones to take the city itself, U.S. officials say. \\n\\\"Truthfully, the Kurds that I\\u2019ve dealt with don\\u2019t intend \\u2013 they\\u2019re not comfortable going into Raqqa. They know they can play a role in shaping and isolating Raqqa but it\\u2019s not their intent to be involved in the actual seizure of the city,\\\" the U.S. military official said. \\nHere is a fact. If YPG doesn't want to enter Raqqa, then SDF can not enter Raqqa. The satellite Arab formations of the SDF have nowhere the strength to face off against the Caliphate. \\nIn fact what the Kurds have been saying recently is that they may be willing to march on Raqqa but it is going to cost the US a lot more in political support and military supplies than what they've been getting so far. SDF Spokesman Talal Ali Silo: \\nOur target is wherever ISIS occupies. Currently, our targets are D\\u00eara Zor and Raqqa. However, al-Bab Military Council is demanding our help. We will meet their demands for militaristic and logistic help. Raqqa Operation requires great power and opportunities. It requires a lot of preparation. \\nWe receive some aid, but it is limited and done covertly. We demanded that International Coalition forces and the US give militaristic and political support overtly and officially. We demanded advanced weaponry, missiles, armored vehicles, panzers etc. They have been promised, but not delivered. \\nThis was two weeks ago, however. Ie, before the Turkish and US-backed rebels attempted an offensive against the Kurdish Afrin enclave. -- Their most ferocious assault against the SDF so far. \\nAs Turkish artillery and aircraft pounded the Kurds in support of attacking Islamists the US limited itself to 'expressing concern', 'calling on all sides to stand down'. US State Department spokesman John Kirby : \\n\\u201cWe are concerned about reports of civilian casualties in recent air and artillery strikes in northern Syria. We call on all sides to stand down and focus on greater threats.\\u201d \\nIn other words, as far as we know the US didn't lift a finger to protect the SDF against Erdogan's 'Euphrates Shield'. Instead it was actually forced to issue denials that it was part of the offensive. \\nIf Turkish media is to be believed Assad actually did more to support the Kurds than the US. Turkish pro-Erdogan media claimed that a Syrian helicopter struck the Turkish-backed rebels killing 2 and wounding 5. Kurds also captured footage ( 1:18 ) of what appeared like a Russian Su-30 fighter in the area -- perhaps as a cover for the helicopter if such a strike indeed took place. \\nAt this point the Kurds aren't worrying about Raqqa. They're worrying about the next Turkish offensive, and how a push to Raqqa would expose them to that : \\nSyria's Kurds fear a \\\"stab in the back\\\" by Turkey if they join a push to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa, one of their chief political leaders told Reuters on Tuesday. \\n\\\"It is very important that Raqqa is liberated. But one point which is bothering us is that, if we go toward Raqqa, we will be stabbed from the back ,\\\" he said. \\nSo here is the deal for Syrian Kurds from the American Empire: Accept only limited recognition and political support. Only limited supplies of weapons of the type you already have. Expect even this limited support to not extend to your Afrin enclave. And in return you get to lose fighters you might very well need against Turkey so US can claim credit for expelling Islamist fanatics from an Arab city before Russia does. \\nGood deal?

If these state are in the process of a recount effort, Trump cannot use their electoral votes in the final tally. A Republican majority Congress would then have to vote to allow Trump to use the votes. The hope is likely that this action would throw Trump s presidency into question with voters, thus setting him up as an illegitimate President in the minds of American citizens. The good news is, the possiblity of a recount in the state of Pennsylvania with 20 electoral votes, is not looking too good for Hillary right now Jill Stein s Hillary Clinton s effort to recount presidential votes in three swing states already appears to be sputtering in Philadelphia.While Stein, a former presidential candidate, has raised millions of dollars and filed for a recount in Wisconsin, the process in Pennsylvania is much more complicated. Candidates cannot file for a recount themselves. Instead, they either have to go to court and attempt to prove widespread voter fraud (there s no evidence of that at this point) or organize a voter-initiated recount effort.Stein s team is going for the latter, asking for thousands of volunteers across Pennsylvania to mobilize. For a voting division   also known as a precinct   to be recounted, three voters from that division must sign and file an affidavit.As of noon Monday, the Philadelphia city Board of Elections had received petitions for 35 of the 1,686 voting divisions in Philadelphia, according to City Commissioner Al Schmidt. He s spoken with organizers who expect another 15 to be filed. That means that only about 50 of the 1,686 voting divisions in Philadelphia, or about 3 percent, would be recounted as a part of Stein s effort.Stein needed more than 5,000 people in Philadelphia alone to sign petitions to file for a recount and would have had to mobilize about 30,000 people statewide to get a full recount going in Pennsylvania. She contends that though her campaign is targeting recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, it is not coordinating with the campaign of Hillary Clinton, who lost all three of those states to President-elect Donald Trump. The Green Party candidate has so far raised nearly $7 million to spearhead the recount.Wanda Murren, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said in a statement Monday afternoon that the state is  working to gather information from the 67 counties regarding their progress in certifying election returns.  She said some counties have already certified their elections, therefore closing the five-day window to petition at the county level for a recount.The deadline for voters to file for a recount is the end of the day today.Meanwhile, officials in Allegheny County have said they will delay certifying their election results as activists are filing petitions seeking a recount.
